Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an authentication method in which a computer user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism:

- knowledge (something the user and only the user knows)
- possession (something the user and only the user has)
- inherence (something the user and only the user is)
